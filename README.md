# NCAA-kaggle-2018

This is my first attempt at the NCAA march madness prediction for Kaggle.

The main challenge this time around was understanding how all the data was layed out, and figuring out how to merge different files together. 

With this in mind I hope to spend more time in creating spreads of team over the regular season and adding new features for next season.
