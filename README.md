# NCAA-kaggle-2018

This is my first attempt at the NCAA march madness prediction for Kaggle.

The main challenge this time around was understanding how all the data was layed out, and figuring out how to merge different files together. 

The features I used this time around include Difference in Seeds, Difference in D1 entry data, and Difference in scores over the regular season.

Now that I figured out how to merge regular season information with the playoff data, I hope to spend more time in creating spreads over the regular season and adding new features for the next season.
